        <p>
            According to the National Ocean Service, a tidal wave is defined as a “shallow water wave caused by the gravitational interactions between the Sun, Moon, and Earth.” Tidal waves (or tides) specifically refer to the waves that are caused by the gravitational pulls of the sun and the moon. Colloquially, tsunamis are referred to as tidal waves; however, this is incorrect as tsunamis are caused by tectonic activity, underwater earthquakes, or even landslides. The sudden upward or downward movement of the seafloor during such earthquakes create large tsunami waves as large amounts of energy is suddenly released into the water, displacing huge amounts of water.
