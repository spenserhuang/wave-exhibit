                <h1>Tsunami Waves</h1>
                <p>
                    Tsunamis (aka seismic sea waves) are caused by one of the four reasons: earthquakes, underwater landslides, underwater volcanoes, or most rarely, meteorite collisions. Typically, destructive tsunamis are caused by large, undersea earthquakes that occur at tectonic plate boundaries as large amounts of energy is suddenly released into the water and huge amounts of water is displaced.

                <p>
                    When tsunami waves hit the shore, the trough (the low point beneath the wave’s crest) usually hits first. A vacuum effect then happens. Seawater is sucked from the coasts, exposing harbors and sea floors.  As tsunami waves have long wavelengths, the larger waves usually hit five minutes after the vacuum effect. It is advised that when one observes the sudden retreat of the shoreline, one should seek high ground until the end of the wave train.

                <h1>Tidal Waves</h1>
                <p>
                    According to the National Ocean Service, a tidal wave is defined as a “shallow water wave caused by the gravitational interactions between the Sun, Moon, and Earth.” Created by energy passing through water, waves transmit energy through the ocean. The most common cause for a wave is wind, as friction between the wind and the surface of the water causes a disturbance. Tidal waves (or tides) specifically refer to the waves that are caused by the gravitational pulls of the sun and the moon. When the Earth rotates, two tidal “bulges” appear due to the pull of the moon and the sun.

                <p>
                    Knowledge about tidal waves is relevant and important given the potential for tidal energy as a renewable source of energy. . There are two main approaches to capturing tidal energy: first, capturing the energy from tidal barrages, and second, from tidal currents.
